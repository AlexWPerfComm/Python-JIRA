# Python-JIRA

A simple Python3 script to authenticate against the Hubwoo JIRA REST API.

Plan is to run a certain method inside with crontab to remind user to put time in, and allow time to be entered within the command line.

Other similar features would be nice as well, suggestions welcome.

Plan:

- Time add
- Time remind
- Summary of tickets
- Alerts to new tickets
- Type issue numbers, get CSV for PlanItPoker
...- Better yet, allow network connection for client, make estimations inside; average posted to JIRA ticket automatically.
- Comment on tickets
- etc.
